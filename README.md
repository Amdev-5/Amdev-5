> I build AI systems that execute real work, stay observable under failure, and respect human control.

Founder building AI B2B SaaS. I design **multi-agent systems** that research, reason, collaborate, and execute production workflows — with **human-in-the-loop control at critical decision points**.

Based in Bangalore, India.

## What I Care About

- Agent orchestration & execution graphs  
- Long-running, stateful, failure-aware agents  
- Human-in-the-loop systems (approval, override, auditability)  
- Tool reliability, evals, and production infra for LLM systems  
- Open-source agent frameworks

---

## Recent Work (last ~3 months)

- Active contributor to an **open-source agent orchestration framework**
  - Agent graphs, MCP tool design, infra-level integrations
  - Working closely with maintainers via issues, reviews, and PRs
- Built **production-grade MCP integrations**:
  - Google Maps (multiple tools)
  - Apollo.io
  - Cal.com
  - X / Twitter  
  Each with live API validation, structured error handling, and test coverage
- Designed and shipped **multi-agent workflows** for real B2B use cases:
  - Research → reasoning → human approval → execution
  - Focus on state consistency, retries, and graceful failure
- Hands-on work with:
  - Agent evals and scoring
  - Tool-call reliability
  - Managing large LLM outputs and execution limits in orchestration engines

(Concrete details live in commits, issues, and PR history.)

## Technical Stack

**AI / Agents**  
Claude · Gemini · OpenAI · LangChain · RAG systems

**Backend**  
Python · FastAPI · TypeScript · PostgreSQL · MongoDB · Redis

**Infra**  
AWS · GCP · Docker · Kubernetes · Terraform

## Open Source

I enjoy working on:
- Agent frameworks that go beyond demos
- Systems where correctness, observability, and failure modes matter
- Codebases with strong abstractions and real users

If you’re a maintainer looking for contributors who think in systems, not scripts — happy to collaborate.

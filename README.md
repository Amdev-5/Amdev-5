Building AI agents that do real work — not chatbots.

Founder building AI B2B SaaS. I design multi-agent systems that research, reason, collaborate, and execute business workflows with human oversight at every decision point.

Currently contributing to an open-source agent orchestration framework. Based in Bangalore.

### What I'm Building

**Multi-Agent Outreach System** — Two AI agents that handle B2B sales end-to-end:
- **Research Agent** — deep prospect research (Apollo, Google Maps, web), personalized outreach, human approval before anything sends
- **Concierge Agent** — deploys on the prospect's side to answer questions, check live availability, and book meetings

No cold email with a Calendly link. An AI concierge that already knows the prospect's company just raised Series B.

**Open Source Integrations** — Google Maps (6 MCP tools), Apollo.io, Cal.com, X/Twitter. Each with full test coverage and live API validation.
